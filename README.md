This theme is developed for Liferay 6.1. It 'a responsive theme, in the sense that it responds well to both mobile and desktop portals. 

I used frameworks such as Velocity and through the API of Liferay I reshaped by the layout override on the navigation.vm. 

Here I used jQuery classical (non-mobile) and even BootStrap this is because the plugins that run on it only used jQuery classic. 

There are also several color schemes to customize the CSS for navigation and setting a variable to handle the url to Sign In as a portal rather than by properties.
